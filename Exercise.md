<h1>Exercise</h1>

Create a Google Colab notebook and title it with the last names of the group members (maximum two members). Load the database named "data" and perform the process of data cleaning and transformation. Review: 
1. Data quality assessment 
2. Data cleaning 
3. Data transformation. 

It is expected that the database does not contain: Missing data, duplicated data, incorrect values, mixed data values, mismatched data types. The database is expected to have all its variables scaled to the interval [0, 1] and its categorical variables encoded.
